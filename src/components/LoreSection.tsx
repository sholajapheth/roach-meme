        The infestation has begun. We are the ones who thrive in the shadows,
        multiplying where others fall. Our unity is our strengthâ€”our culture,
        our shield. Whispers speak of rituals, secret gatherings, and a bond
        that cannot be broken.

        Are you ready to connect the dots? Will you join the swarm?

        We multiply. We survive. We thrive in the darkness. Our memes are our
        magic, our laughter our weapon. In every act, harmony weaves the unseen
        threads that strengthen our bond. <br />
        <br />
        Step into the circle. Become part of the legend.
